# Predicting-MLB-Pitch-Outcomes

The paper and Rmd file contained in this repository are a part of a group research project completed for a Machine Learning in Econometrics course taken during the Fall 2020 semester. The goal of the project was to answer prediction question using machine learning methods learned in the course on any approved dataset. Since our group had a collective interest in sports, we decided to investigate how well we could predict the outcomes of a given pitch in baseball using Statcast data. For the scope of the data, we chose to look specifically at pitches thrown by Tampa Bay Rays pitchers during the 2020 MLB season. The Statcast, pitch-level data was obtained with the help of the baseballr package. Attached in the repository is the final paper and an Rmd file with the code used to compile and clean the data as well as the code used to produce many of the models considered.
